# SMART-FIRE-DETECTION-PROJECT
Used to detect and message the authorities then and there it is very useful.
The Smart Fire Detection System leverages deep learning-based image analysis to detect fire in real time. Unlike traditional fire alarm systems that rely on smoke or heat sensors, this system uses computer vision to recognize fire patterns directly from camera inputs such as CCTV feeds.

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on diverse fire and non-fire datasets enables the model to accurately differentiate between actual fire incidents and false positives (like candles or lighting). Integrated OpenCV modules perform frame-by-frame video analysis, while TensorFlow handles model inference to ensure efficient real-time performance.

The system includes an automated alert mechanism that triggers notifications upon detection, offering faster response times, wider coverage, and improved reliability compared to conventional systems. This makes it ideal for smart buildings, industrial environments, and surveillance-based fire safety systems.
